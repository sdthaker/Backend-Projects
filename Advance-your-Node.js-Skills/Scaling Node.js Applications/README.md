# Scaling Node.js Applications
Learnt sophisticated programming techniques that can help scale Node.js applications. Went over the scale cube, discussing the different directions in which an app can be scaled: along the x-axis, z-axis, and y-axis. Worked on cloning, specifically fork Node.js processes and work with clusters in PM2. Learnt how to set up horizontal partitioning to split data between databases, as well as how to decompose applications into microservices.
