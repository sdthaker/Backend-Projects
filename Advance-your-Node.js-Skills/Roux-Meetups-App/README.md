# Roux Meetups App
Worked on basic microservices concepts and putting them into practical action in a Node.js context, using Node.js to build out a microservices architecture from scratch. Worked on essential concepts like service discovery and resilience. Explored a common use case in which an existing monolithic app was split into individual services. 

## Learning objectives
* Setting up a service registry
* Registering and deregistering services
* Versioning and load balancing
* Adding the service logic
* Working with the circuit breaker
* Using queues
* Consuming and storing feedback
