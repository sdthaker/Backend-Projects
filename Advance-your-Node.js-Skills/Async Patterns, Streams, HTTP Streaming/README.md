# Async Patters, Streams & HTTP Streaming
Learnt advanced techniques for asynchronous programming and data streaming in Node.js. Used asynchronous patterns such as callbacks, promises, and async/await to manage processes and enforce sequential, parallel, and concurrent execution. Worked on streams, a critical feature for reading and writing data from Node.js applications. Implemented streams—readable, writeable, duplex, and transform—and minimized backpressure, or buildup, in data transmission. Combined the techniques and built a HTTP server for streaming video over the web. Learnt how to ensure the stream is cross-browser compatible and collect multipart/form-data, such as text data and files, from the upload stream.

## Learning outcomes:
* Asynchronous patterns
* Resolving and rejecting promises
* Sequential, parallel, and concurrent execution
* Working with readable and writeable streams
* Transforming streams
* HTTP streaming
