# Building RESTful APIs

Created a simple, RESTful web API with Node.js—the popular JavaScript runtime environment—and the Express web framework. Set up the Express server and testing environment, and created the endpoints needed to add, update, and delete data from a MongoDB database. Served static files such as images with this API. Additionally explored libraries that can help streamline API development, such as Koa and LoopBack.

## Learning objectives
