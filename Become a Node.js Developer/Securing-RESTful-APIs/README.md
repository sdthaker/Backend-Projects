# Securing RESTful APIs
Learnt about various options for securing RESTful API that can help keep the application data—and users—safe.  Set up and secured a Node and Express API, including how to add handlers for registration and login, finalize secured endpoints, and test the finalized API. The course also introduced me with an overview of top security threats and an introduction to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), an important resource on security.

## Learning objectives
* Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
* Reasons for using a JSON Web Token (JWT)
* Adding bcrypt password hashing
* Adding handlers for registration and login
* Finalizing secured endpoints
* Testing APIs with Postman
