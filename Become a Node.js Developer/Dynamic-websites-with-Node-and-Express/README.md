Built a realistic and robust website using Node.js. Transformed HTML into dynamic pages, leveraged template engines to modularize code, added routing and business logic, handled errors, stored form data, and created API endpoints for single-page applications. Along the way, I also learnt bits and pieces about Express.js and improved my overall knowledge of how to work effectively with Node.js.

## Learning objectives:

* Creating a basic Express.js application
* Serving HTML pages and static content
* Creating routes
* Using templates
* Handling errors in Express.js
* Handling POST requests
* Storing form data
