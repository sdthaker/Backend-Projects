# Real Time Web with Socket.IO

Utilized the the power of Socket.IO—a web library that enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication—and built a chat app with multiple rooms. Created a server with Express and Socket.IO, coded front-end HTML, and created a chat with the emit function. Added a namespace, coded a new room within the namespace, and set up multiple rooms for users.
